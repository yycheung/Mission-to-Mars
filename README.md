# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to gathering information, including paragraphs, images and tables from Nasa's webpages, focusd on mission to Mars. By writing a python script to gather all the information and then showcase the result in a web application. First, we write a Python script that uses BeautifulSoup and Splinter to gather all the information we needed. Then store it using MongoDB which is a NoSQL database. Finally, weâ€™ll build a web application using Flask. Our web application will have a button that executes our scraping code and then updates the pages to display the newest data.

Tools used include:
1. Splinter, to automate a web browser
2. BeautifulSoup, to extract elements from that HTML table, but to leave the rest
3. MongoDB, to stroe the sraped data
4. Flask, a web framework that allows us to create a web application using Python and then customize it with HTML and CSS
